An updated version of the Crazy Coffee Concoctions app. This new frontend connects to a Node.js backend.

## Usage

To start the app, go to the [index.html](index.html) file and open it in your browser. In order to avoid any CORS-related issues, it is recommended that you use an extension in your development environment to connect to your local server. If you use VSCode, try the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). For more information, check out [MDN's article on setting up a local testing server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/set_up_a_local_testing_server).
